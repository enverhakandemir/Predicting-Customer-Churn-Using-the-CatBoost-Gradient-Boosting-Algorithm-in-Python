# Predicting-Customer-Churn-Using-the-CatBoost-Gradient-Boosting-Algorithm-in-Python

**Suggested Steps:**

* **1-Load Data:** The script reads an Excel file, in my case data file containing telecom churn data.
* **2-Feature Encoding:** Converts categorical variables into numerical format (one-hot encoding or label encoding).
* **3-Chi-Square & Cramer's V Analysis:** Computes significance levels and associations.
* **4-Mutual Information Test:** Measures dependency strength between features.
* **5-Machine Learning (CatBoost):** Trains a model, evaluates performance, and visualizes feature importance.
* **6-Visualization:** Heatmaps, decision boundaries, ROC curve, and SHAP values.

**Key Features:**

* **Statistical Analysis:** Chi-square, Cramer's V, and Mutual Information tests to identify key features influencing churn.
* **Machine Learning:** CatBoost model with SMOTE oversampling for accurate churn prediction.
* **Feature Importance:** Analysis of feature importance using CatBoost's built-in feature importance.
* **Model Evaluation:** Decision boundary graphs, ROC-AUC curves, SHAP values, and loss curves for detailed model evaluation.
* **Visualization:** Heatmaps and graphs for easy interpretation of results.

**Visualizations:**

* **Heatmaps for Chi-Square, Cramer's V, and Mutual Information.
* **Feature Importance ranking from CatBoost.
* **ROC Curve for model evaluation.
* **SHAP Summary & Heatmap for interpretability.
