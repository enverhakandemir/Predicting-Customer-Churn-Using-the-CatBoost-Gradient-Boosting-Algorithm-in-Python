# Predicting-Customer-Churn-Using-the-CatBoost-Gradient-Boosting-Algorithm-in-Python


**Key Features:**

* **Statistical Analysis:** Chi-square, Cramer's V, and Mutual Information tests to identify key features influencing churn.
* **Machine Learning:** CatBoost model with SMOTE oversampling for accurate churn prediction.
* **Feature Importance:** Analysis of feature importance using CatBoost's built-in feature importance.
* **Model Evaluation:** Decision boundary graphs, ROC-AUC curves, SHAP values, and loss curves for detailed model evaluation.
* **Visualization:** Heatmaps and graphs for easy interpretation of results.
